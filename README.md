# Adv_DL_challenges

This repository contains the challenges proposed during the course of Advanced Deep Learning and Kernel Methods, held @UniTS.

The repository is divided into three subfolders:
- `data/`: containing the datasets useful for the challenges.
- `notebooks/`: containing the Python notebooks with the code implemented.
- `reports/`: containing the `.tex` and `.pdf` format of the reports where I summarize the obtained results.
